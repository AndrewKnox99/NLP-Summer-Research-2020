# NLP Summer Research 2020
Project web scraped 1,700+ college news articles, ran Latent Dirichlet Allocation on them, and visualized changes in topics before and after covid.

# Specific Aims:

1. Identify latent topics in over 1,700 news articles in two time-slices: before covid-19, and after covid-19

2. Analyze how prominent topics were, when they emerged and withdrew from the spotlight, and the sentiment that they were written with.

# Workflow:

1. Gathered online articles from three different universities for a total of 1,782 articles.

2. Partitioned the dataset of articles into pre-covid and post-covid and ran Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on both datasets.

3. Visualized the percentage of articles that were produced each month for each topic.

4. Performed sentiment analysis on articles that comprised each topic.
